# String Calculator
## Description
The String Calculator calculates the sum of the integers provided in the string. 
- Allowed to handle an unknown number of numbers (in the string) and handle new lines between numbers (as well as commas)
- To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string should be a separate line formatted like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers]‚Äù
- Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception "Negatives not allowed: " and then listing all negative numbers that were in the list of numbers
- Numbers greater than 1000 should be ignored
- Delimiters can be any length
- Allow multiple delimiters
